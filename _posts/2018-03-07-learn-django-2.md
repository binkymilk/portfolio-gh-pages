Today, I was able to deploy my Django site to the web!

First, I started creating a blog app in my Django site. Next, I created a git repo and pushed all my files. I admit, tinkering with github was really a pain since I'm a newbie in this kinds of things. I don't know, I just can't get the hang out of github commands. (Look at the irony of posting here in github.) But anyway, I would really like to learn this. Maybe that's why I'm spending hours googling errors and scratching my head looking for something to work.

Going back, I also created an account in PythonAnywhere which basically puts your website up for free! That was easy since everything else was automated.

Now, you can visit my first site here: http://binkymilk.pythonanywhere.com/

That's it for today. 

안녕~
