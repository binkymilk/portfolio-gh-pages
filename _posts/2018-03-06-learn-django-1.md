# Learn Django

So here's the first part of my journey in learning Django. A bit of a background check: I've already learned Django (in a quick way) last year so I have enough knowledge to understand the basics. A new project has come up (yay!) which uses Django so I'm up learning it again. I forgot about the syntax and how each python file actually works but I can follow pretty well.

Today, I learned about the basics of Django. I first created a virtualenv (a really important step especially when you have various projects). This was the one that was skipped on my first days of learning Django last year and I'm glad that the process is actually easy and not a pain in the head.

The next part was installing Django. There were a lot of commands used and I can't remember them all, but I know they'll be one click away only for me to remember. Also, I tweaked a little in settings.py to be able to host the Django page to a web server.

And it works! I finally have a Django-powered page.

I'll continue learning Django tomorrow (as it is 2 AM in here already).

안녕~
