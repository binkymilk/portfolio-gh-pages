# Introduction

I have always wanted to improve my skills on data analysis and data visualization so I've decided to test myself out by doing a series of viz challenges every week. I actually got inspired by the Viz Battles in [/r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) so I decided to challenge myself using their datasets. Every week, I'm going to post a narrative regarding my development process as well as my experiments in finding the perfect visualization for conveying the most important insights. 

Warning: it's going to be messy as this is just for practice and I wanted to explicitly show the nitty gritty process of data analysis. 

Also, constructive criticisms are welcome!
