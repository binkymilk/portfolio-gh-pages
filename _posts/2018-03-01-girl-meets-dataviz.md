Hi!

This post will be the start of my journey in learning Data Visualization and Analysis. 

Ever since I saw that Hamilton visualization, I got intrigued on what they call 'Data Visualization'. I clicked a few Google links regarding the topic and found out that it combines two of my most favorite things on earth: designing and programming. Because of this, I decided to pursue Data Visualization in all of its forms, from the raw data gathering, to data analysis, to data visualization. 

I've set a few goals for me to accomplish so that by the end of the semester, I'll be able to say that I finally have adequate knowledge about the topic. I'll be posting blog entries everyday, since I'll be dedicating an hour of my time for learning. (I don't promise this though, I might get spontaneous deadlines and forget to post one.)

For the next few weeks, I'll be covering Wes McKinney's Python for Data Analysis book. I'll document my progresss on this blog as well.

I hope I'll be able to accomplish all my goals and have fun in learning as well!
